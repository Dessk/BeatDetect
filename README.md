# BeatDetect

Simple beat detector in C.\n 

Project status: Work in progress. \n
-There is no documentation whatsoever\n
-Current output data is not very useful. I'm using this format only for visualization. I'll change it later. \n
-Not optimized.\n

Standard beat detector:\n
Status: Almost finished \n
Desc:\n
- This algorithm should provide good beat detection in rap/hip-hop/etc. \n
- Do not use it with noisy songs (rock/metal/etc.)\n 

Advanced beat detector:\n
Status: Work in progress\n
- Some problems with algorithm. \n
- Still working on it.\n
