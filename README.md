# BeatDetect

Simple beat detector in C.

Project status: Work in progress. 
-There is no documentation whatsoever
-Current output data is not very useful. I'm using this format only for visualization. I'll change it later.
-Not optimized.

Standard beat detector:
Status: Almost finished 
Desc:
- This algorithm should provide good beat detection in rap/hip-hop/etc. 
- Do not use it with noisy songs (rock/metal/etc.)

Advanced beat detector:
Status: Work in progress
- Some problems with algorithm. 
- Still working on it.
