# BeatDetect

Simple beat detector in C.

Project status: Work in progress.<br/>
- There is no documentation whatsoever
- Current output data is not very useful. I'm using this format only for visualization. I'll change it later.
- Not optimized.

Standard beat detector:<br/>
Status: Almost finished<br/>
Desc:
- This algorithm should provide good beat detection in rap/hip-hop/etc. 
- Do not use it with noisy songs (rock/metal/etc.)

Advanced beat detector:<br/>
Status: Work in progress<br/>
- Some problems with algorithm. 
- Still working on it.
